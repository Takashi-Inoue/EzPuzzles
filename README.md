EzPuzzles is free Puzzle Game for windows.
Enjoy with your favorite images!

##**Games**  
This app includes 3 type games with an image.

- Simple Slide : 15 puzzle. Simple is best.  
- Simple Swap  : It's like 15 puzzle. But clicked piece doesn't "slide". It "swap" to a specified piece.
- Mine Sweeper : You know it. But it is little bit different than the "Windows Minesweeper". Right click has same action that left click. An image is gradually visible while pieces are opened. If you missed, you can play the game continually, but you can't watch a perfect image.

If you have vcruntime error, please execute vcredist_x64.exe file.
